Meeting Notes 

7/25/16 
Attendees: Nate, Christy, Vienna 

Discussed project requirements, software structure, mechanical design and next steps 

Desired/Predicted procedure: 
  - Turn on computer, controller, camera 
  - Home the prior stage 
  - Load wafer slide (slide preparation is a seperate procedure, refer to Nate) 
  - Adjust Focus
    - Drive stage to wafer object, bring to sharp focus. 
  - Define search area 
    - treat as bounding box, drive to top left starting point, record position (UI button) then drive to bottom right and record position. 
  - run program. 
  
Program Structure/Procedure
  -Create mosaic of sample (no need to stitch initially, unless the counts are significantly off) 
  -Start in upper left corner of bounding box 
  -progress in serpentine motion: 
    - move to specified image location
    -trigger camera 
    -save image to XXX folder with unique name (eg. wafer_count_MM-dd-YYYY_(X,Y)_unique_id.bmp) 
  - access images and iterate though the folder, return a cumulative count of the wafers to the user
    - initial image processing has been developed, see file(s) named:  
      -Wafer.py 
      -image_splitting_for _wafer_counting.py #this is only necessary if the mosaic image is provided as a single stitched image 
      -wafer_image_analysis_for_count.py 
  -delete images 
  
User interface Requirments 
  -Live image display (for focus adj) 
  -STOP button 
  -start/stop positions button (for defining image capture bounding box) 
  -homing button 
  
Hardware 
  Camera: Prosilica GigE (by Allied Vision) 
  Microscope: 
    Current: CX41 (incompatible with automated stage) 
    Suggested replacement: BX41(obsolete) or BX43 
    Stage: H101ANNN (by Prior Scientific) 
    Objective Magnification: 20X

Current Concerns: 
  -Camera SDK (for python) 
  -Picture resolution, pixel shape, necessary cropping 
  -Mapping step distances to camera pixels 
    - Might need a micorscope slide with grid features to help with pixel mapping / calibration 
      -Likely available from throlabs, newport, edmundoptics, etc. 
  -Compatible microscope components and obsolete components 
    - BX41 is available all over ebay and far cheaper then buying a new BX43 but is technically obsolete, which may be okay, can't imagine changeing the microscope body will change software design if we want to upgrade in the future. 
    - Olympus sales rep said there might be some problem if we are going to sell this as a product to consumers because we might be "competeting". Need to create a novel system somehow. Our own software may be enough. 
  -stage movement, need to know when a move command has been sent and went it has been completed.
