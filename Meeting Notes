Meeting Notes 

7/25/16 
Attendees: Nate, Christy, Vienna 

Discussed project requirements, software structure, mechanical design and next steps 

Desired/Predicted procedure: 
  - Turn on computer, controller, camera 
  - Home the prior stage 
  - Load wafer slide (slide preparation is a seperate procedure, refer to Nate) 
  - Adjust Focus
    - Drive stage to wafer object, bring to sharp focus. 
  - Define search area 
    - treat as bounding box, drive to top left starting point, record position (UI button) then drive to bottom right and record position. 
  - run program. 
  
Program Structure/Procedure
  -Create mosaic of sample (no need to stitch initially, unless the counts are significantly off) 
  -Start in upper left corner of bounding box 
  -progress in serpentine motion: 
    - move to specified image location
    -trigger camera 
    -save image to XXX folder with unique name (eg. wafer_count_MM-dd-YYYY_(X,Y)_unique_id.bmp) 
  - access images and iterate though the folder, cumulatively adding the wafers counted
    - initial image processing has been developed, see file(s) named:  
      -Wafer.py 
      -image_splitting_for _wafer_counting.py #this is only necessary if the mosaic image is provided as a single stitched image 
      -wafer_image_analysis_for_count.py
